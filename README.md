# React and GitHub API

In this project, we build a small React app which shows the public Github repositories of a user. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Here's what the application will look like once you are done:

Let's take a look at the code that's already there. 
*  `package.json:` Configuration file for NPM, contains dependencies and project metadata
*  `.gitignore:` Files that should be ignored by Git. `node_modules` can always be regenerated
*  `public/index.html:` File that gets served thru Webpack after having been filled in
*  `src/index.js:` This file is the entry point for the app. It puts our app on the screen!
*  `src/ResultShow.js:` This file is a component of the application
*  `src/Searching.js:` This file is a component of the application
*  `image:` It includes some picture or gif used in the project

## Prerequisites Requirements
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
 * Node.js - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the npm package manager. If you encounter any problems, you can also use this [GitHub Gist](https://github.com/nodejs/node) to install Node.js.
## Downloading the project
There are several ways you can get the project:
### Cloning The GitHub Repository
The recommended way to get the project(-ReactAppTask) is to use git to directly clone the -ReactAppTask repository:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/SaiShangAI/-ReactAppTask.git reactapp
```
This will clone the project repository to a `reactapp` folder.
### Downloading The Repository Zip File
Another way to use the -ReactAppTask boilerplate is to download a zip copy from the [master branch on GitHub](https://codeload.github.com/SaiShangAI/-ReactAppTask/zip/master). 


## Quick Install 
Once you've downloaded the boilerplate and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting to develop your application.

The boilerplate comes pre-bundled with a package.json files that contain the list of modules you need to start your application.

To install the dependencies, run this in the application folder from the command-line:
```
$ npm install
```
## Running the project
Run your application using npm:
```
$ npm start
```
The application will run on port 3000. So it will go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
